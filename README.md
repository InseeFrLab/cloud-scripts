# Cloud scripts

Collection of scripts to deploy stuff on the cloud.  
Currently 2 modules :

- `dcos-on-aws` : deploy `D2IQ` `DC/OS` on `AWS`
- `gke` : create and configure a Kubernetes cluster on `Google Kubernetes Engine`
- `kubespray` : deploy Kubernetes using [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) (walkthrough using VMs from GCP)
- `post-install-kub` : various ideas on what to install on a brand new cluster :)

Feedback welcome.  
Please create an issue if something is wrong and Pull Requests are also welcome !
